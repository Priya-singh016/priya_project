**Task Management System**



The Task Management System is a web application designed to streamline task assignment and tracking within an organization. It is built using a modern tech stack comprising React.js for the frontend, Node.js with Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database. The system incorporates robust user authentication and role-based access control to ensure data security and privacy.

üåê Features
User Authentication:

The system provides secure authentication for both Managers and Users.
Authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
Role-based Access Control:

Distinct roles (Manager and User) are defined with specific privileges.
Managers have the authority to assign tasks to users, while users can view assigned tasks and update their status.
Task Management:

Managers can create tasks and assign them to individual users or teams.
Users have access to their assigned tasks, allowing them to track progress and mark tasks as completed.
Enhanced Security Measures:

Rate limiters are implemented for authentication API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.
IP access control is enforced to restrict access to authorized users and devices.
SSL certificate generation and utilization ensure encrypted communication between the server and client, enhancing overall system security.
üñ•Ô∏è Tech Stack
Frontend:

React.js for building the user interface.
Utilizes CSS and Bootstrap for styling.
Incorporates React Bootstrap for enhanced UI components.
Backend:

Node.js with Express.js for server-side development.
MongoDB serves as the data storage solution.
